<p>You know nothing and the sooner you accept that, the better you will be for it. In the words of the great Richard Feynman "If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics". And I don't think this applies to just quantum mechanics. Literature, science, art, design, product, management, music, psychology and just about everything else you can think of is immensely vast and nearly impossible to learn completely. Everything we can possibly think of learning has a whole universe of it's own and we're merely seeing a very small part of the bigger picture.</p><br/>

<p>And it truly is humbling. If I had a penny for everytime I was fascinated by something in my own professional field I'm pretty sure I'd have quite a lot of pocket money by now. I'm sorry but this blog post is going to get a little preachy. I have apologized and you have been warned. Whenever I hear someone say that they already know everything about something with <i>pucham</i> (closest translation: condescension), I can't help but think that they just haven't read deep enough to know that there's probably a whole world of knowledge left in whatever it is that they said they know already. I must admit, I too am guilty of this. But I do tend to catch myself doing this and realise I'm being an idiot. Just today I was having a conversation with a friend and we were discussing something academic and how they're just so much information and intricacy in the smallest topics and he said to me "Are we really engineers?" and well I don't think we are. By that I don't mean we aren't doing our job well or that we're not what we claim to be. I just said we aren't for dramatic effect really but what I'm trying to convey is that no one can ever know everything about anything, and in this case it's engineering. And that's fascinating and we should all be fascinated by it. And we should also be hungry to learn more and more and more until we don't now what to do with ourselves anymore. Ever since college ended I probably spend most of my days and most of my hours just trying to gather all the knowledge I can, reading as many articles I can. Not because I want to go throw this knowledge around as some sort of weird flex. But at this point I'm just so fascinated by everything that I just want to keep learning about everything. When I say everything I don't mean <i>everything everything</i>. For me everything is everything related to computers, discrete maths, computational theory and so on.</p>
<p>I'm sure when Issac Newton was around he knew the most about physics and calculus and was probably the world's #1 authority on these subjects, but we now know for a fact that he wasn't even close to knowing everything. Eistein proved that gravitation was so much more than what newton discovered and still to this very day, we don't entirely understand gravity. And there's a whole wealth of information left to be gained from this.</p>
<p>So by assuming you already know something, you are simply limiting yourself and the rest of us. To think we know something is arrogant and detrimental. So much of what we have learned as humanity has been because we chose to question the teachings and beliefs of our predecessors. And I think it is not enough for us to wait for other people to come around and question our beliefs to then further expand on them. We should constantly be questioning our own beliefs and thoughts. Only then can we progress and advance. So in conclusion, always assume you don't know anything, keep learning, keep questioning the things we know until you reach the boundaries, at which point progress begins.</p>
