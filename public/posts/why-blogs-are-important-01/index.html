<p>Let me preface this by saying that I am not a writer of any sort. I am an engineer by profession and that is what you should see me as. I think this is the 3rd blog I've started and let's hope this one sticks.</p>
<p>Blogs and journals are some of the oldest forms of self expression on the internet and are still to this day the most widely used form of it. Some of the most interesting things I've learnt are from blog posts and articles. There's just something about them that's so....</p>
<p><i>Why are blogs important?</i> Cause reasons.</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>You can remain anonymous -</b> Most people are scared of putting themselves out their. Just start a blog under a pseudonym.</li>
    <li><b>It doesn't have to be perfect -</b> You can always just hit <strike>bakspace</strike> backspace and rewrite bits that you don't like.</li>
    <li><b>You don't need much to start -</b> You don't need fancy equipment like a camera and editing software to make one.(Although some really good vloggers use just their phones and do an amazing job). All you need is a computer. Even the shittiest one with a minimal internet connection will do.</li>
    <li><b>It's you own little space -</b> You make the rules. I want emojis now. &#x1F61C;</li>

<p>I don't religiously follow blogs. I'm the sort of person who will read as many medium articles as I can before it asks me to create an account. At which point i'll become sad and then move onto other sources. Some of the most interesting things I've learnt are from blog posts. I mostly read blog posts and articles for educational purposes(Nerd alert! &#x1F913;). One blogpost I will always remember is <a target="_blank" href="https://gendal.me/2013/11/24/a-simple-explanation-of-how-money-moves-around-the-banking-system/" style="color: blue">A simple explanation of how money moves around the banking system</a>. At first I was extremely confused but then a sit-down with my brother who is a Chartered Account cleared things up. And this is precisely why I've started this blog. If Gendal had never made that blogpost, I would have never read it and I would be none the wiser about the world of banking. Sure, it's not some life skill I needed but I'm glad I know it now. And so I'd like to think I know some things really well, much like Gendal knows about how money moves around the banking system. And maybe there's somebody else like me out there who wants to read random blog posts and articles about things I know about. Or whatever... Idk. I just want to write blog posts now. Because I like reading them so much.</p>
<p><i>That's why blogs are so important.</i> Cause it allows people like me to sit and vent. It allows me to share my experiences and my knowledge. It allows me to learn things I wouldn't otherwise. So if any of you reading this are on the fence about starting a blog or writing a post for one you started ages ago but haven't in a while, just bite the bullet and do it. I'm glad I did.</p>
