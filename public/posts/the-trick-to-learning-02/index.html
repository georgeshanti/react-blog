<p>If you're not in the mood to read a blog post about how school doesn't matter and it's what you put your effort into that matters, then don't read this. Just close the tab and go on with your merry day because that's exactly what this blog post is about. But this post also isn't about how the education system is broken or how it's pumping out ill-equipped adults.</p>
<p>My friends will have you believe that I'm really smart. That maybe true, I <i>maybe</i> very smart. But it's not because I put any effort into being smart. Academically, I was a very average student. I have written several papers twice. Some even thrice &#x1F610;!  Despite this, I'm <i>smart</i>. What I think made me come off as smart was my random bits of knowledge bombs that I gained from reading articles and tutorials. <u><i>Like the fact that docker containers don't actually do anything new. Process isolation has been around in Linux for ages in the form of Linux Control Groups. Boom! Random knowledge bomb!</i></u>

<p>I'm as curious as they come. If I find something cool then by all means I will find out how it works and build it myself. I don't care that it already exists, if I like it then I'll make it my own. Sort of like how you tell yourself you can try to make that fancy dessert at home. Hint hint, you can't cause you're lazy. Not me though, I'm not lazy when it comes to this. I will scour the internet for the tiniest bit of insight into the thing I want so that I have a starting point. At which point I just try to wing it till I make it. And so I've realised that there are two approaches to learning. Both of which apply to different scenarios.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Learn by doing</li>
    <li>Learn by reading(listening, watching, whatever)</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Learning by doing</i> -- This is great when you want to use something. No one would ever teach you to use a pair of scissors, you'd just use it till you figured out not to poke yourself in the eye with it. This is how I learned most of the things I know. Like web development, I didn't care how the web worked. I just wanted to build a website because I thought it was cool. So learning HTML, Javascript and CSS was just a means to an end. If in 2013 I knew I could build a website with some website builder, I wouldn't have learnt it. I just wanted to know how to use the tools to make myself a website. I didn't care about how they worked.</p>

<p><i>Learning by reading</i> -- This is what you need when you want to know how something works. You could use a scissor for a long time and still not know how it works. It's working wouldn't make sense until someone explained pressure, torque and leverage. How things work are usually underlying systems which is hard to see or recreate to learn from. But much easier to understand if someone just told you. That could be a person, a book or a video. So my knowledge about how browsers render HTML, CSS and Javascript, and how data is transfered from server to client all came from reading. Please note, I didn't know any of this when I was building websites 7 years ago.</p>

<p>I've generally noticed that learning by doing is quick and dirty while by reading is slow but clean. But both are required if you really want to learn something. For me the story has generally been:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Oh that's cool. I'll make that.</li>
    <li>I bet the internet knows something about that. Oh I found a Getting Started Guide/Tutorial!</li>
    <li>Read the first few lines of code. Close the browser</li>
    <li>Try and write the whole thing in a painful trial and error process. Half reading more articles every time I hit a roadblock.</li>
    <li>Finally make the thing in a shitty, hacky manner and call it a day.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now this happens of several things for several months. Until a couple of months later this happens</p>
<ol start="6">
    <li>Oh look! An article about some of the things I did.</li>
    <li>Oh so that's what I was doing..... Oh that's not how I should have done that, was it?</li>
    <li>Finally read more articles about what I was actually doing and how it all actually works</li>
    <li>Until finally I can connect all the dots, for my knowledge bomb.</li>
</ol>

<p>So we all need both kinds. One to use and the other to understand. Sure it might not be efficient and I might not have a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tsar+bomb" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">Tsar</a> Knowledge Bomb, but at least I have some TNT to blow some minds.</p>
<p>So if you're wondering what to learn and how to learn(you know who you are). Just build some random shit, you'll figure it out as you go along.</p>

<b>Side note, not related to post:</b>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">I actually think the education system works fine. It's public perception that's bad. The education system markets to its customers. The customers here are not the students, it's the parents. And parents want their kids to learn science and math and become doctors and engineers. And the educational institutions aren't going to cater to the students who are the real stakeholders. Because students themselves cannot and will not enroll themselves in schools. It's the parents who do the enrolling so obviously schools will cater to them. So yeah, education system works fine. If you want to change the education system then change the way the people think, the system will change to meet the new market requirement.</p>
